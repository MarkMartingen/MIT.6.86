# MIT.6.86
Some implementations of algorithms and methods presented at 6.86 - Machine Learning with Python .

THe idea of the repo is to absorb and integrate what I quickly learned during the MIT 6.86 course on EdX. The pace was fast and I need to redo the contentst by myself, whenever possible, implementing the algorithms from scratch, so that I am sure that I understand how the work. 

There are no big or challengind projects here, at least not now. I work woith mock-up data, and try to refrain to standard python libraries and numpy and matplotib. I consciously avoid more sophisticated libraries with already implemented ML algorithms, as this is meant to be an exercise.

If you happened to take the course as well and you would like to contribute to the code and co-learn in that way, please do not hisitate to contanct me.
