# MIT.6.86
Some implementations of algorithms and methods presented at course 6.86 - Machine Learning with Python - hosted on EdX and being a part of the MicroMaststers Program in Statistics and Data Science.

THe idea of the repo is to absorb and integrate what I quickly learned during the MIT 6.86 course on EdX. The pace was fast and I need to redo the contentst by myself, whenever possible, implementing the algorithms from scratch, so that I am sure that I understand how they work. 

There are no big or challenging projects here, at least not now. I work woith mock-up data, and try to refrain to standard python libraries and numpy and matplotib. I consciously avoid more sophisticated libraries with already implemented ML algorithms, as this is meant to be an exercise to gain a thorough understanding of the underlying algorithms.

If you happened to take the course as well and you would like to contribute to the code and co-learn with me in this  way, please do not hisitate to contanct me.
